# 1. Write a simple function called 'greet' that prints "Hello, World!".
#    Call the function to demonstrate how it works.

# 2. Write a function called 'add_two_numbers' that takes two numbers as parameters
#    and returns their sum. Demonstrate calling the function and printing the result.

# 3. Write a function called 'multiply_numbers' that takes two numbers as parameters
#    but returns nothing (just performs the multiplication). Demonstrate scope by printing a variable
#    inside the function, and show what happens when you try to print it outside the function.

# 4. Write a function called 'is_even' that returns True if a number is even and False if it's odd.
#    Use the return value of the function in an if-else statement to print an appropriate message.

# 5. Write a function called 'find_max' that takes three numbers as parameters and returns the largest one.
#    Test your function with different inputs and print the result.

# 6. Modify the 'find_max' function to show how scope works by introducing a local variable
#    inside the function and print it. Then, try printing it outside the function.
